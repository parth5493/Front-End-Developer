    <h2>Short Circuiting</h2>
    <p>What is the use of short-circuit operator?
        A short-circuit operator is used in advavced javascript to execute a second argument 
        when the first argument's outcome is not sufficient to evaluate the full expression</p>

    <p>Sometimes we need to use something before intialization. 
        We can not proceed in javascript 
        as it is synchoronous languages(all code excecuted at same time not line by line like in other languages).
        In this situation, we need to use short-circuitong concept in advavced javascript. It symbol is "?". 
    </p>
    
    <script>
        let user = "Kriva"
        console.log(user.parth);

      //console.log(3.hiral); // this gives us error.
        console.log(3?.hiral); // this will works. It short circuited with ?. we use hiral variable before intailization.

        let hiral = "Wife"

        if (true == true || foo.foo) {
            console.log("Called inside if"); // short circuiting with OR || operator
        }

        if (false && foo.foo) {
            console.log("Called inside else"); // short ciruiting with AND && operator
        }
    </script>
