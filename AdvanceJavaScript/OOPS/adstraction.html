    <title>Abstraction Practice</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. 
        In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.</p>
    <p>Here we need to call each functions to perform.</p>    
    <ul>
        <li>Helps the user to avoid writing low-level code.</li>
        <li>Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.</li>
        <li>Can change the internal implementation of a class independently without affecting the user.</li>
        <li>Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the
            user.</li>
    </ul>    
    <script>
        class Class1{
            function1(a){
                this.x = a+1 // We are making this function for intialize and implementation.
            }   
            function2(){
                console.log("Called only functionality:", this.x); // We are making this function to perform functionality.
            }
                 
        }           

        let object = new Class1
            object.function1(2)
            object.function2()
