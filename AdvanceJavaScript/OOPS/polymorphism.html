    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>When we want to perform different funtionalities with same function, which concept called polymorphism.</p>
    <p>It is concept of overriding.</p>
    <p>With this concept, same function which declares last called.</p>
    <p>Features</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Programmers can use the same method name repeatedly.</li>

    </ul>
    <script>
        class Class1{
            addition(a){
                console.log("Called Addition 1 Function:",a);
            }
            addition(a,b){

        }

        // Overriding Concept Starts


        //let object = new Class1 // It is overriding 1st addition function and 2nd Addition function Called.
      /*  let object1 = new Class2 // It is overiding 1st and 2nd addition function and called 3rd addition function.
