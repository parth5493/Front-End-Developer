    <h2>Destructuring</h2>
    <p>Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, and maps 
        and set them into new, distinct variables. 
        Destructuring allows us to extract multiple properties, or items, from an array​ at a time.</p>
    <p>It is data structures for object and array.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Objects allow us to create a single entity that stores data items by key.</li>
        <li>Arrays allow us to gather data items into an ordered list.</li>
    </ul>  
    
    <p>Where can we use Destructuring?</p>
    <p>Destructuring assignment is a special syntax that allows us to “unpack” arrays or objects into a bunch of variables, 
        as sometimes that’s more convenient.</p>

    <p>Destructuring also works great with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on.</p>

        // Array Destructuring9

        let arr = ["Kriva", "Patel"]

        let [firstname, lastname] = arr

        console.log(firstname);
